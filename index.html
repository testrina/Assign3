            <h2>Phase One: Sketching Visualizations</h2>
When looking at the data, I found it really interesting that the population peaked in the middle aged group in the 2000s, whereas in the 1900s the age group sizes were pretty consistently decreasing over time. This definitely was influenced by the baby boom after the war, however It seems that the sporadic distribution of ages has implications beyond merely diagrams. I want to explore this question in this assignment.

                <li>This first drawing is inspired by the ‘dear data’ precedent to create a sketch-like data visualization.</li>
                <li>The intention here was to have the age groups each represented by an individual strand coming from the center, with each length corresponding to that age groups population. These strands were intended to have to parts, one for 1900 in a darker color and 2000 in a brighter color. </li>
                <li>the color coding of the strands would separate the different groups - the dependents, the workforce, and the elderly from each other visually.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>The first thing that comes to mind when I think of population representations is a population pyramid. However, generally these diagrams are concerned about the male to female ratio, so I wanted to play with that and represent a comparison between the two centuries instead.</li>
                <li>Here, one side of the pyramid represents the 1900s and the other the 2000s, with each bar representing the population of an age group.</li>
                <li>This diagram aids in understanding the two populations in comparison to one another very well.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>Inspired by the above population pyramid and a 3D printed population pyramid I have seen online, I sketched an idea of a 3D population pyramid.</li>
                <li>Here, there are two pyramids that make up the one drawing with tiers for each age group. </li>
                <li>In order to attempt to incorporate the genders as well the two ellipse geometries have one dimension representing male and female populations in that age category.</li>

        I thought making these sketches was really fun but also quite a bit of a challenge. It was difficult to think outside of the typical graphs or charts that are usually seen. I think that while the first sketch was the most visually interesting as an artwork it is also the hardest to understand the data dn very difficult to separate the 1900 data from that of the 2000. The second sketch, while more legible, does not prove to be anything unique. The third sketch I find the most intriguing as it is able to bring many more dimensions (pun intended) into the data while retaining the ease of reading.

            <h2>Design Process & Design Decisions</h2>


            <p>
I really liked the third sketch from part 1 of the exercise and I wanted to carry it forward into this portion. I decided to make the 3D model in Rhino, so that I could have an accurate representation of the data rather than artistic impression as I would in Illustrator or similar software. I wrote a Grasshopper script within Rhino to extract the data from the .csv file and transform it into forms. 
        <figure>

At first, I was testing two options for the visualization - one using circular extrusions for each age group and another using ellipse-shaped extrusions where one dimension represented the male population and the other the female. While I rendered both, I felt it was very difficult to see the difference between the two axes when the object is viewed not in 3D space, so I decided to go with the circular geometry.

            The ellipse shaped visualization test I did not end up choosing.

I decided to render the age groups with the three primary colors and divide them in three groups - dependents(0-15), workforce(20-60), elderly(65-95). The two pyramids are then placed in relation to each other so that the viewer can easily compare the two. 


I then moved to the task of labeling the pyramids. I decided to indicate the corresponding years for each at the top as I am assuming this diagram will be read from top to bottom. Next came the ‘age’ axis indicating the increments for the population’s age, which I ended up placing between the two pyramids in order to make legibility easier - as I felt when it was on the side of either of them it was too far from the other. 


In terms of labeling, I decided to indicate the ‘categories’ I devised for each year, along with the total population within that bracket and the percentage of the total population. I feel that these additional values help put the data into perspective and help the viewer compare the  proportions of the population between the two years easily. At first I began to add labels for each of the tiers, but then I realized this approach was too cluttered, difficult to read, and the side labels summarized it fairly well. I also added the total population for each year underneath the label for the years themselves at the top.
