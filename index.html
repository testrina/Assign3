            <h2>Phase One: Sketching Visualizations</h2>
When looking at the data, I found it really interesting that the population peaked in the middle aged group in the 2000s, whereas in the 1900s the age group sizes were pretty consistently decreasing over time. This definitely was influenced by the baby boom after the war, however It seems that the sporadic distribution of ages has implications beyond merely diagrams. I want to explore this question in this assignment.

                <li>This first drawing is inspired by the ‘dear data’ precedent to create a sketch-like data visualization.</li>
                <li>The intention here was to have the age groups each represented by an individual strand coming from the center, with each length corresponding to that age groups population. These strands were intended to have to parts, one for 1900 in a darker color and 2000 in a brighter color. </li>
                <li>the color coding of the strands would separate the different groups - the dependents, the workforce, and the elderly from each other visually.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>The first thing that comes to mind when I think of population representations is a population pyramid. However, generally these diagrams are concerned about the male to female ratio, so I wanted to play with that and represent a comparison between the two centuries instead.</li>
                <li>Here, one side of the pyramid represents the 1900s and the other the 2000s, with each bar representing the population of an age group.</li>
                <li>This diagram aids in understanding the two populations in comparison to one another very well.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Design Process & Design Decisions</h2>


            <p>
I really liked the third sketch from part 1 of the exercise and I wanted to carry it forward into this portion. I decided to make the 3D model in Rhino, so that I could have an accurate representation of the data rather than artistic impression as I would in Illustrator or similar software. I wrote a Grasshopper script within Rhino to extract the data from the .csv file and transform it into forms.

At first, I was testing two options for the visualization - one using circular extrusions for each age group and another using ellipse-shaped extrusions where one dimension represented the male population and the other the female. While I rendered both, I felt it was very difficult to see the difference between the two axis when the object is viewed not in 3D space, so I decided to go with the circular geometry.

            The ellipse shaped visualization test I did not end up choosing.

I decided to render the age groups with the three primary colors and divide them in three groups - dependents(0-15), workforce(20-60), elderly(65-95).
